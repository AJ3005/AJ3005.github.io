              John is a cattle farmer. He lives in one of the towns, and
              needs to know the coming forecast to plan for his cattle rotation
             and will hopefully sell some to make some extra money for
              vacation. He mainly uses a desktop, but does have a
              phone that he uses for the weather (current
              temperature) or for notifications about weather alerts.

              Sarah is in college, and is
              planning to visit one of the three towns for family. She is
              concerned with the weather during her visit, and is looking at the
              site to find what events are happening during her visit. She 
              uses her phone to search the web.
